# Project 3 - Analysis of Drowning Cases in the Sea in Catalonia (2025)

## Introduction

This project was inspired by recent drowning cases in the sea in Catalonia, a region in Spain. My main curiosity was to find out if there was any pattern and if there were specific locations where drownings occurred more frequently.

## Project Workflow

### 0. Data Acquisition and Preparation

- Collected data from all official government press releases.
- Cleaned the data using Google Sheets for better structuring.
- Geolocated the points to be able to map them.
- Requested official data from the government to cross-check and validate the information collected.

### 1. Creating the Map (2025)

- Used QGIS to:
  - Obtain the ocean, land, and coastline layers.
  - Import a CSV file containing coordinates where drownings occurred.
  - Import the CSV again to display flags and related icons.

- Icons used:
  - Flag: *Flag* by Iain Hector - [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/browse/icons/term/flag/) (CC BY 3.0)
  - Drowned: *Drown* by Adrien Coquet - [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/browse/icons/term/drown/) (CC BY 3.0)
  - Footer drown icon: Ian Rahmadi Kurniawan - [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/browse/icons/term/drown/) (CC BY 3.0)

- Fonts used:
  - [Fira Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans)
  - Georgia

- Color palette (created with Adobe):
  - #A5BFDD
  - #5F7793
  - #f2e3c7

- I tried to make the map interactive using aihtml, but was unable to fully integrate it into the website. Instead, I created a simpler scrolling image webpage using scrollama and generated .png images of each step from the map to embed.

### 2. Extracting and Analyzing Historical Data

- 2025 data: manually recorded from the Catalan government press notes to build my own dataset, mainly used to geolocate drowning sites. Initially tried Google Maps API, but switched to using `geopy.geocoders` and Nominatim. (See notebook: `Geolocate_beach_2025.ipynb`)

- Past decade data: requested from the press department, who provided Word documents listing cases including date, gender, beach, age, nationality, lifeguard presence, and flag color. Performed cleaning and extraction to build a dataframe. (See notebook: `extracting_drownedinfo.ipynb`)

- Analysis: explored number of drownings by comarca (county). (See notebook: `Drowned_all_analysis.ipynb`)

### 3. Creating Visualizations

- Created a liquid wave graphic with help from ChatGPT based on this example: [Stack Overflow example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65300031/d3-liquid-water-chart-conversion-from-d3v3-to-v4)

- Built a temporal evolution chart of drownings over the past decade using D3 Observable, embedded as SVG in `index.html`. The live version is available here: [Evolution of Drownings in D3 Observable](https://observablehq.com/@journa4data/evolution_drowned)

- Other graphics (e.g., showing most drownings occur when lifeguards are present and the flag is green, confirmed by historical data) were created with Flourish.

## Areas for Improvement

- Add information on which regions have the highest number of victims.
- Learn to geolocate more efficiently using Google Maps API.
- Fully master embedding ai2html SVG images despite no longer having an Illustrator license.

## Final Reflection

This project was an opportunity to apply a wide variety of languages and tools learned over the past 10 weeks. It was a lesson in time management, managing expectations, and how to redirect a project when encountering difficulties. It also taught me to overcome frustration when not knowing everything perfectly but still pushing forward to finish a project that offers significant learning and value.
